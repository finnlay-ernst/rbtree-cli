# rbtree-cli
Description: A simple red black tree that the user can interact with via the command line
Languages: JavaScript

## Development Tasks

- [x]  Chose testing framework (Jest vs Mocha, etc)
- [x]  Find a good page documenting rules
- [ ]  Setup project structure and Git
- [ ]  Determine what functions to support (find, size, flatten, etc)
- [ ]  Implement function stubs & tests
- [ ]  Implement functions

## Testing

We are going with Jest here as it is a more wholistic testing suite. Mocha is also good but requires us to find separate assertion libraries and whatnot. Jest is also built into React, so learning this testing framework will help when I move into learning React.
